# OpenFit

Working towards open source patterns for jeans, based on traditional pattern making techniques, new pattern making algorithms, and 3d mesh-driven approaches. We're also exploring the possibilities of automated measurement as input to pattern making tools, and as the basis of 3d meshes.

*By the Book"* uses a pattern drafting algorithm found in [Threads Magazine: Fitting for Every Figure](http://www.amazon.com/Threads-Fitting-Every-Figure-Magazine/dp/B00E8V3N7Y). *Draft from Center* uses our own pattern algorithm.  *Measure* is a Kinect-driven measurement tool.
